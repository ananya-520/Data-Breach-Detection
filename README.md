# Data-Breach-Detection

# Introduction
This project presents the Cybersecurity Project: Data Leak and Breach Detection System, a cutting-edge solution designed to help companies protect their most valuable asset—their data—from theft, sale, or misuse by hackers and data brokers. The system provides proactive protection by detecting data leaks in real-time, ensuring organizations can respond to threats before significant damage occurs.

# Project Description
Our system acts like a high-tech security guard for company data. Here’s how it works:
Secure Data Storage: Data is stored in a secure, encrypted database using AES-256 encryption and bcrypt hashing.
Web Scanning for Leaks: The system constantly scans the internet, including data broker sites and dark web marketplaces, using tools like BeautifulSoup and Selenium.
Data Comparison Without Exposure: Uses SHA-256 hashing to create unique “digital fingerprints” of the data.
AI-Powered Anomaly Detection: Machine learning models analyze patterns to distinguish between legitimate data transfers and potential leaks.
Real-Time Alerts and Response: Instant alerts are sent to the company with details about the leak.



# Installation Guide

**Prerequisites**
Before installing, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Operating System: Windows / macOS / Linux
- Python: Version 3.8+ (Check with python --version)
- Git: (Check with git --version)
- Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended): venv or conda

**Clone the Repository**
Use Git to clone the project from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-leak-detection.git
cd data-leak-detection

**Create a Virtual Environment**

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

**Install Dependencies**

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install necessary libraries such as:
